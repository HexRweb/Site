<h1 class="center">TWMaker- Projects from HexR</h1>
<p>TWMaker is a project developed for high school students to be able to quickly access their teacher's websites</p>
<p>It asks you a few questions to create a website with 8 tabs (one for each block)</p>
<p>That way you only have one link to remember, and can access their website anywhere!</p>
<p>TWMaker is being discontinued as of the 2015 Fall semester and will be replaced by StashBoard - The modern student dashboard which will make customobility and administration much cleaner, nicer and easier to use.</p>
