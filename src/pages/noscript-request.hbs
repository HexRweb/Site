	<p class="flow-text">It looks like you have javascript disabled! We get that, there's a lot of bloatware on the web. We normally use a request form for website requests, but it requires javascript to prevent spam submissions.* We have a dedicated inbox for website requests, so please <a href="mailto:request@hexr.org">send us an email</a> instead of using the form. Thanks for your understanding!</p>
